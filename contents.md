# Preliminary contents

1. FREEBIE inverse mode calculation for a given shape, p and <j>.
2. Reconstruction by EFIT from FREEBIE with available diagnostics (Rogowski coils, flux loops, TS)
   * accuracy vs noise 
   * accuracy vs p' ff' degrees
3. Rapid reconstruction by EQUINOX radial basis functions
4. Possible enhancements -- synthetic dianostics
   * MSE
   * LCFS position (e.g. probes)
_Optional_
4. _FREEBIE in inverse mode for COMPASS as a shape designer, scenario designer)_
5. _VDE simulation compared to experiments_
6. _METIS/FREEBIE comparison to experiments_
