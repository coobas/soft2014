    title = {{2D interpolation and extrapolation of discrete magnetic measurements with toroidal harmonics for equilibrium reconstruction in a Tokamak}},
    author = {Faugeras, Blaise and Blum, Jacques and Boulbe, C{\'e}dric and Moreau, Philippe and Nardon, Eric},
    abstract = {{We present a method based on the use of toroidal harmonics and on a modelization of the poloidal field coils and divertor coils for the 2D interpolation and extrapolation of discrete magnetic measurements in a Tokamak. The method is generic and can be used to provide Cauchy boundary conditions needed as input by a fixed domain equilibrium reconstruction code like Equinox. It can also be used to extrapolate the magnetic measurements in order to compute the plasma boundary itself. The proposed method and algorithm are detailed in the paper and results from numerous numerical experiments are presented. The method is foreseen to be used in the real time plasma control loop on the WEST Tokamak.}},
