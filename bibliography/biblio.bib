   Abstract = {The COMPASS-D tokamak, originally operated by UKAEA at Culham, UK, win be reinstalled at the Institute of Plasma Physics (IPP) AS CR. The COMPASS device was designed as a flexible tokamak in the 1980s mainly to explore the MHD physics. Its operation (with D-shaped vessel) began at the Culham Laboratory of the Association EURATOM/UKAEA in 1992.
The COMPASS-D tokamak will have the following unique features after putting in operation on IPP Prague. It will be the smallest tokamak with a clear H-mode and ITER-relevant geometry. ITER-relevant plasma conditions will be achieved by installation of two neutral beam injection systems (2 x 300 kW), enabling co- and counter-injections. Redeployment of the existing LH system (400 kW) is also envisaged. A comprehensive set of diagnostics focused mainly on the edge plasma will be installed.
The scientific programme proposed for the COMPASS-D tokamak installed in IPP Prague will benefit from these unique features of COMPASS-D and consist of two main scientific projects, both highly relevant to ITER - Edge plasma physics (H-mode studies) and Wave-plasma interaction studies.
The COMPASS-D tokamak will offer an important research potential as a small, flexible and low-cost facility with ITER-relevant geometry.},

    abstract = {{We present a method based on the use of toroidal harmonics and on a modelization of the poloidal field coils and divertor coils for the 2D interpolation and extrapolation of discrete magnetic measurements in a Tokamak. The method is generic and can be used to provide Cauchy boundary conditions needed as input by a fixed domain equilibrium reconstruction code like Equinox. It can also be used to extrapolate the magnetic measurements in order to compute the plasma boundary itself. The proposed method and algorithm are detailed in the paper and results from numerous numerical experiments are presented. The method is foreseen to be used in the real time plasma control loop on the WEST Tokamak.}},
