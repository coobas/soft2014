\section{Abstract}

Various MHD (magnetohydrodynamic) equilibrium tools, some of which being recently developed or considerably updated, are used on the medium-size COMPASS tokamak [R. PÃ¡nek et al., Czech J Phys 56, B125, 2006]. MHD equilibrium is a fundamental property of the tokamak plasma, whose knowledge is required for many diagnostics and modelling tools. Proper benchmarking and validation of equilibrium tools is thus key for interpreting and planning tokamak experiments. We present here benchmarks and comparisons to experimental data of the EFIT++ reconstruction code [L.C. Appel et al., to be submitted to Nucl. Fusion], the free-boundary equilibrium code FREEBIE  [J.-F. Artaud, S.H. Kim, EPS 2012, P4.023], and a rapid plasma boundary reconstruction code VacTH [B. Faugeras et al., PPCF 2014, accepted]. We demonstrate that FREEBIE can calculate the equilibrium and corresponding poloidal field (PF) coils currents for given plasma parameters. Both EFIT++ and VacTH can reconstruct equilibria generated by FREEBIE from synthetic diagnostic data (including an artificial noise) and hence might be suitable for real-time control. Optimum reconstruction parameters are estimated; in addition, possible enhancements using more diagnostics are discussed and simulated using synthetic diagnostics. FREEBIE can also calculate the temporal evolution of the poloidal field coils currents for a whole plasma scenario.
