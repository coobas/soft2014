   Abstract = {The COMPASS-D tokamak, originally operated by UKAEA at Culham, UK, win be reinstalled at the Institute of Plasma Physics (IPP) AS CR. The COMPASS device was designed as a flexible tokamak in the 1980s mainly to explore the MHD physics. Its operation (with D-shaped vessel) began at the Culham Laboratory of the Association EURATOM/UKAEA in 1992.
The COMPASS-D tokamak will have the following unique features after putting in operation on IPP Prague. It will be the smallest tokamak with a clear H-mode and ITER-relevant geometry. ITER-relevant plasma conditions will be achieved by installation of two neutral beam injection systems (2 x 300 kW), enabling co- and counter-injections. Redeployment of the existing LH system (400 kW) is also envisaged. A comprehensive set of diagnostics focused mainly on the edge plasma will be installed.
The scientific programme proposed for the COMPASS-D tokamak installed in IPP Prague will benefit from these unique features of COMPASS-D and consist of two main scientific projects, both highly relevant to ITER - Edge plasma physics (H-mode studies) and Wave-plasma interaction studies.
The COMPASS-D tokamak will offer an important research potential as a small, flexible and low-cost facility with ITER-relevant geometry.},

   Abstract = {We present a method based on the use of toroidal harmonics and on a modelization of the poloidal field coils and divertor coils for the 2D interpolation and extrapolation of discrete magnetic measurements in a tokamak. The method is generic and can be used to provide the Cauchy boundary conditions needed as input by a fixed domain equilibrium reconstruction code like Equinox (Blum et al 2012 J. Comput. Phys. 231 960-80). It can also be used to extrapolate the magnetic measurements in order to compute the plasma boundary itself. The proposed method and algorithm are detailed in this paper and results from numerous numerical experiments are presented. The method is foreseen to be used in the real-time plasma control loop on the WEST tokamak (Bucalossi et al 2011 Fusion Eng. Des. 86 684-8).},

   Abstract = {The Integrated Tokamak Modelling (ITM) Task Force aims at providing a suite of codes for preparing and analyzing future ITER discharges. In the framework of the ITM, the universal access layer (UAL) provides the capability of storing and retrieving data involved in simulation. The underlying data structure is hierarchical and the granularity in data access is given by the definition of a set of consistent physical objects (CPOs). To describe the data structure of the overall ITM database, the XML schema description (XSD) has been used. Originally intended to describe the structure of XML documents, XSD is used here to provide an unambiguous way of describing how data are structured, regardless of the actual implementation of the underlying database.
The MDSplus-based UAL implementation is currently under test and other prototypes for investigating alternative data storage systems are foreseen. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
