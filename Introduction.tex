We report here on validation and verification of tokamak equilibrium tools used for the COMPASS tokamak \cite{compass2006}. We particularly focus on fundamental global plasma parameters and the shapes of magnetic flux surfaces, which are crucial in diagnostics interpretation and other analyses. 
EFIT++ \cite{efitpp2006} is used for routine equilibrium reconstruction on COMPASS. FREEBIE \cite{freebie2012} is a recent free-boundary equilibrium code; FREEBIE enables predictive equilibrium calculation consistent with the poloidal field (PF) components of the tokamak. In this study, FREEBIE is used in the so-called inverse mode, which predicts PF coils currents from a given plasma boundary and profiles. The third code employed in this study is VacTH \cite{vacthref}, which provides a fast reconstruction of the plasma boundary from magnetic measurements using a toroidal harmonics basis.

In order to verify and validate the aforementioned tools, we analyse EFIT++ and VacTH reconstructions of equilibria constructed with FREEBIE. Synthetic diagnostics (e.g., magnetic probes or flux loops) with optional artificial errors provide inputs for the reconstructions.
